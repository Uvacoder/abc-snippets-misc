<h1>Q&A</h1>

<h4>What is the difference between "undefined" and "not defined"</h4>

```javascript
var x;
console.log(x);
```
Here the `x` is declared but not defined, so when we `console.log`it the output come `undefined` because it is declared but any value was defined it

```javascript
console.log(y)
```
After if we  `console.log(y)` that was never declared, the output will be `not defined`.
